# DIY Gen AI

Repository for workshop with LM Studio, Hugging Face, and Ollama

These instructions will guide you through configuring a GitHub Codespaces environment that you can use to run the course labs. 
If you prefer to install LM Studio directly, you can get it from https://lmstudio.ai. Note that for Mac, it is only supported on systems with the M# chips. 

If you install it yourself, some elements in the labs may be different for your setup. The instructions here will reference running in the codespace environment.

If you wish to use the codespace environment which will provide you with a running instance of LM Studio, follow the instructions below.

**1. Click on the button below to start a new codespace from this repository.**

Click here ➡️  [![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/skillrepos/diy-gen-ai?quickstart=1&idle_timeout_minutes=90)

**2. Then click on the option to create a new codespace.**

This will run for 10 minutes or more while it gets everything ready.

NOTE: At the end, after the codespace is actually started, it will still be running some post-startup scripts that will take a few more minutes to complete as shown below:

The codespace is ready to use when you see a prompt like the one shown below in its terminal.

**3. Open up the *labs.md* file so you can follow along with the labs.**
You can either open it in a separate browser instance or open it in the codespace. If you open it in the codespace, make sure to *Open Preview* so you can see it in Markdown form as intended.

**Now, you are ready for the labs!**

**4. (Optional, but recommended) Change your codespace's default timeout from 30 minutes to longer (60 for half-day sessions, 90 for deep dive sessions).**
To do this, when logged in to GitHub, go to https://github.com/settings/codespaces and scroll down on that page until you see the *Default idle timeout* section. Adjust the value as desired.

**NOTE: If your codespace times out and you need to reopen it**

1. Go to https://github.com/your-github-userid/codespaces
2. Find the codespace in the list, right-click, and select *Open in browser*
3. After the codespace opens up, run the script *./scripts/startLMStudio.sh* in the terminal. (You might need to run this more than once if restarting a codespace depending on timing.)
```
./scripts/startLMStudio.sh
```
